### Summary


### Architecture
- On control plane:
	- etcd
	- API server
	- scheduler
	- controller manager
- On worker nodes:
	- kubelet
	- kubernetes service proxy
	- container runtime
- Communication by components and api server are usually initiated by the components.
- Most of the resources (expect for kubelet) run as pods in the `kube-system` namespace.

### etcd
- fast consistent, distributed, key-value store.
- The API server is the only thing that talks to etcd.
- keys in etcd look like directories, but they are just strings really. like `/registry/configmaps/...`
- Uses RAFT algorithm to achieve consistent state.

### RAFT algorithm
- Majority rules. If the cluster goes into a "split-brain" situation, the split with more etcd instances will have the true state. 
- Usually there is one "leader" that handles requests and coordinates updates to cluster state.
- The side with minority becomes read only until all instances are synced back up to a new state.

### API Server
- A RESTful API that can perform CRUD operations on the etcd.
- An interface for querying and modifying the cluster state.
- `kubectl` is one of the clients we are familiar with using to communicate to the apiserver.
- A client request goes through 4 main stages.
	- Authentication: Figures out who you are.
	- Authorization: Figures out if you can do what you want.
	- Admission Control: Modify resources for different reasons, like init missing fields or overriding them.

- The API server is _observed_ by other components. So changes to a resource by the API server may alert another resource that is interested in that change.
- For instance, if a resource is created, changed or deleted, the control plane component is notified.
- Every time an object is updated, the server sends the new version of the object to all connected clients that are subscribed to it.

### Scheduler
- All the scheduler does is update the pod definition through the API server.
- The kubelet (who watches the API server for updates) is the one who actually deploys the pod.
- It first finds _acceptable pods_ by looking at hardware resources, pod affinity and more.
- It then picks the best option from the bunch.

### Controllers running in the Controller Manager
- The controllers do the job of converging to the desired state as specified in the resources deployed through the API server.
- There is a controller for each resource, to basically manage it.
- â˜… "Resources are _descriptions_ of what should be running in the cluster, Controllers are the **_active_** kubernetes components that perform the actual work as a result of the deployed resources."
- Each controller subscribes to the API server for the resources they are responsible for. (Using "watch" mechanism).

### Controllers
- **ReplicaSet Controller**: It sees that the desired pod state is not met, it creates new Pod manifests and posts them to the API server. Then it lets the scheduler and kubelet do their jobs.
- **Deployment Controller**: It works by creating or removing replicasets.
- **Namespace Controller:** When a namespace is deleted, all the resources are also deleted.
- **Endpoints Controller**: Keeps the endpoints list constantly updated with the IPs and ports of pods matching the label selector.

### Kubelet
- Registers the node its running on by creating a Node resource.
- Monitors the API server for pods that have been scheduled to its node.
- It then starts those Pod's containers.
- It also monitors all the containers and reports their status to the api server.
- Kubelet is the thing running the container liveness probes and restarts then when they fail.
- It can also run containerized versions of the control plane.

### kube-proxy
- One kube-proxy runs on each node.
- The kube-proxy watches for changes to services using the api server's watch mechanism and updates the [[iptables]] rules depending on the ips of the pods. 
- iptables perform the actual load-balancing.

### How DNS server works
- All pods use the cluster's internal DNS by default.
- kube-dns pod watches for changes to services and endpoints and updates the dns records with every change.

### How Ingress controllers work
- Its a [[Reverse Proxy]].
- Watches for changes in ingress, services, and endpoints resources and updates the config of the proxy server (e.g. nginx) accordingly.
- It does **not** involve iptables, the reverse proxy handles the traffic in this case.
- It routes directly to the Pods and does not go through services at all.
