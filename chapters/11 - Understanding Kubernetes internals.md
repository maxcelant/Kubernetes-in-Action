### Summary


### Architecture
- On control plane:
	- etcd
	- API server
	- scheduler
	- controller manager
- On worker nodes:
	- kubelet
	- kubernetes service proxy
	- container runtime
- Communication by components and api server are usually initiated by the components.
- Most of the resources (expect for kubelet) run as pods in the `kube-system` namespace.

### etcd
- fast consistent, distributed, key-value store.
- The API server is the only thing that talks to etcd.
- keys in etcd look like directories, but they are just strings really. like `/registry/configmaps/...`
- Uses RAFT algorithm to achieve consistent state.

### RAFT Algorithm
- Majority rules. If the cluster goes into a "split-brain" situation, the split with more etcd instances will have the true state. 
- Usually there is one "leader" that handles requests and coordinates updates to cluster state.
- The side with minority becomes read only until all instances are synced back up to a new state.

### API Server
- A RESTful API that can perform CRUD operations on the etcd.
- An interface for querying and modifying the cluster state.
- `kubectl` is one of the clients we are familiar with using to communicate to the apiserver.
- A client request goes through 4 main stages.
	- Authentication: Figures out who you are.
	- Authorization: Figures out if you can do what you want.
	- Admission Control: Modify resources for different reasons, like init missing fields or overriding them.

- The API server is _observed_ by other components. So changes to a resource by the API server may alert another resource that is interested in that change.
- For instance, if a resource is created, changed or deleted, the control plane component is notified.
- Every time an object is updated, the server sends the new version of the object to all connected clients that are subscribed to it.

### Scheduler

### Controllers Running in the Controller Manager
- The controllers do the job of converging to the desired state as specified in the resources deployed through the API server.
- There is a controller for each resource, to basically manage it.
- â˜… Resources are _descriptions_ of what should be running in the cluster, Controllers are the _active_ kubernetes components that perform the actual work as a result of the deployed resources.
- Each controller subscribes to the API server for the resources they are responsible for.
